# snapshot-service

This is an AWS lambda service set up with [serverless](https://serverless.com) that takes a snapshot of all the sites that we want for archiving and comparing later. A snapshot includes screenshots of the site, but also a copy of the HTML, CSS, and JS that was used to generate it.
